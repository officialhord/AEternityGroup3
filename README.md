# Monkey

### What is Monkey?
>Monkey is a blockchain based data collation center that is Review System and a social media to it’s users.
Most social media systems are governed and owned by one body, this is why twitter can decide to suspend a user for reasons known to them and facebook can also block access to an account because it is owned by facebook and not the one who thinks he owns it.
Users or most centralized social media today are not in control of their own data and cannot decide who gets their data and who doesn’t, so daily and per second data analysis are done with these information about users and these users are not paid for these, technically we’ll say we have been used right? Yeah very true.
This is why Monkey is here, to also use every user but this time keeping them rewarded for access to their data. 

### What problem are you solving exactly?

Every organization wants to know the reaction of their customers to their goods and services, in the same way every customer wants the manufacturer of the good or service they just consumed to know what they feel about it.
We are building a decentralized social media system that takes out the middle men who enrich their own pockets by gathering this data and selling to these organizations and builds a direct link between the organizations and the public at the same time allowing regular social activities to keep the system alive after reviews.
In likewise manner giving the user total control of their account, such that no ones ever has to be suspended anymore for no reason, and the governing body becomes the community of users on the platform and not two men sitting on a chair in an office somewhere in the world.

### Who are the customers/stakeholders? 
The customers and stakeholders are the general public, every consumer of a good or service, every regular person making social connections.
The major stake holders though are the organizations that need the data for one analysis or the other.

### What need do they have?
Well since technology has made it easier, the stake holders will be playing the role of miners, they’ll be in charge of producing Monkey coin which will in turn be distributed to the users in a percentage based curation system.
All that is required are smart phones for the users and mining equipment for the major stakeholders.

### How is this addressing their need?
Providing the organizations the data they need to improve their production from personality traits to the least important and giving the public a chance to be paid from usage of their data and carrying out regular social media activities.
Every social media now has influencers who only get paid to advertise which is not meant to be so.

### Are you planning to carry out a token generation event or ICO?
ICO

### what is your token about?
The token generated will be used as stake, voting right, toll, function, currency, earnings and value exchange.

### Is it a security or a utility token?
Security token

### What’s the economics of your token?
Internet Economy
This is because it is light-asset based and transaction related information is already digitized.
To keep the prices stable and increasing, a fee would be charged for operations like transfers, and posting on the chain. For transfers a 1% charge of the amount being transfered would be deducted from the user’s available monkey and almost unnoticeable amount for posting, this charges could be burnt daily to reduce the amount of monkeys in circulation.

### You have an investor who just bought 65% of your token supply. What do you do?
The best thing is to avoid an occurrence of this nature. To achieve this, three ICO’s will be carried out, each having only 30% of the available supply totaling to 90%, during each ICO a user will be allowed to purchase 10% of the available supply for that ICO, this way a user can only have 9% of the total supply available.

### Explain why your project needs blockchain? Is it really necessary?
The project needs a blockchain.
Why because, The state is to be stored, multiple writers are involved, there is no always online trusted third party, all the writers are known but not trusted and is the public verifiability required? no it isn’t.
Using Karl Wustl and Arthur Gervais and T. Koens & E. Poll the system will use a private distributed ledger.

### How do you make use of data in your project? 
User data collated in the system are used in to carry out analysis for stake holding organizations to be able to improve their product and service quality.
This data can be gathered from requested surveys, reviews and regular posts that are analyzed to pick personality traits and interactions.


### How do you envision smart contracts to be of use in your project? Create a graphic similar to these:
Digital Identity - Hold information of users and control peer to peer transactions

### What components can be automated in the long run?
Gaming, HealthCare, Education, sales of goods and services making use of the token for transaction and transaction charges.
